We have one old template from our designer from 2012. And seems like we have to use it now for our new back site.
Please create one page in zip.
You have to use bootstrap as a base, html5/css3.
The main banner suppose to be a slider with some navigation throught it - bullets I guess (jquery).
All products are links.
